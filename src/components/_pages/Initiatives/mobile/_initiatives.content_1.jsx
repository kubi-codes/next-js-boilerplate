          We partner with governments, businesses, civil society groups and
          others to change the way the world produces and uses food and energy
          and designs its cities. Our 100+ projects span from advising mayors on
          how to reduce traffic fatalities to working with restaurant chains to
          cut food waste to powering rural healthcare facilities with clean
          energy. We mobilize global and regional initiatives that spur
          international climate action, advance sustainable ocean management,
          halt tropical deforestation, restore degraded landscapes and more.
