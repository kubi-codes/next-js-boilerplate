          FOSTER is an inspiring initiative spearheaded by YBDA (Yayasan Bahtera
          Dwipa Abadi) and TJF in partnership as a research organization.
          <br />
          <br />
          This project aims to unlock the potential of tidal swamp land in the
          Indragiri Hilir Regency to ensure food security at local, regional,
          and national levels.
          <br />
          <br />
          Despite the location’s technical and non-technical challenges, FOSTER
          is committed to establishing a research center that will serve as a
          beacon of hope for the local community. Through testing, training, and
          the development of innovative practices, this center will help
          cultivate food crops, livestock, and freshwater aquaculture,
          ultimately improving the lives of many.
