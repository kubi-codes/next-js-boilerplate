          Pulau Burung’s suboptimal land is the overlap of flatland, lowland,
          wetland, and peatland. In managing land with peat characteristics,
          water management becomes the most important aspect of ensuring
          sustainability.
          <br />
          <br />
          In his days, our founder worked on a water management system to
          address the challenge of suboptimal land. The soil is highly porous,
          which allows too much water seepage and excessive evaporation, which
          become more serious during the dry seasons. The Water anagement
          Trinity (WMT) was then established for capturing and keeping
          freshwater as a resource instead of letting it leave back to the
          ocean. <br />
          <br />
          The WMT comprises of three main components (i.e. the Canals, the Dams
          and Water Gates, and the Dikes) which supports the three aspects of
          sustainability. It is still being used until now and has been
          acknowledged as first of its kind in the world.
